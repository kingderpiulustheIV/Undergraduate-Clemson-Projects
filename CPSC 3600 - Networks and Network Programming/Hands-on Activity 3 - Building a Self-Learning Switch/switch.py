    Represents a message intended for transmission across a simulated network environment. This class encapsulates
    the essential components of a network message: its source, destination, and the data payload. It is specifically
    designed for client-to-client communication via switches; switches facilitate the forwarding process based on
    the destination address without altering the message itself.

    Attributes:
        src_name (str): The name of the client sending the message.
        dst_name (str): The name of the intended recipient client of the message.
        data (str): The actual content of the message being sent.

        __str__: Returns a human-readable string representation of the Message instance.

    Inherits from the Host class and acts as a network switch in a simulated network environment. This class
    is responsible for connecting clients and switches, receiving messages from clients, updating the forwarding
    table based on source addresses, and forwarding messages either directly to the destination (if known) or by
    broadcasting to all connected clients except the sender.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Inherited from the Host class, represents the name of the switch.
        adjacent_hosts (dict): A dictionary mapping the names of directly connected hosts (both switches and clients)
                               to their instances.
        forwarding_table (dict): A dictionary acting as the forwarding table for the switch, mapping destination
                                 client names to the client instance through which the switch last received a message
                                 from that client.

    Methods:
        connect_client: Establishes a connection between this switch and a client or another switch.
        receive_from: Handles incoming messages from connected clients or switches, updates the forwarding table,
                      and forwards the message appropriately.
        broadcast: Broadcasts a given message to all connected hosts except the sender.
