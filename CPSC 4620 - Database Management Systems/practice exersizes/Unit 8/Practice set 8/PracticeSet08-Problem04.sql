-- The Developer team wants to ensure that all the emails in the OWNER table are stored as lowercase
-- in the database. You need to create a BEFORE trigger for any INSERT statement on  OWNER table.  
-- Name your trigger "email_insert".  You should be able to create this trgger with 1 SQL command.
-- 
-- Once created, you can verify that the trigger was created with this command
-- 	SHOW TRIGGERS;
--

CREATE TRIGGER email_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON OWNER FOR EACH ROW SET NEW.OwnerEmail = LOWER(NEW.OwnerEmail);
