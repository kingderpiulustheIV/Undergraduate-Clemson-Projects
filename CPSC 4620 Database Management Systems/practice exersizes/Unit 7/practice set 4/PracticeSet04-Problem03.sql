-- ## Problem 3:
-- 
-- The House Development team considers that having a limited availability of houses in a state 
-- could be risky and less beneficial for the business. For Example, The InstantStay will be unable 
-- to process the reservation requests if the request count is higher than count of registered houses
-- in the state currently available to rent out. 
-- 
-- Therefore to take further steps to work on such issues, the team requires to know all the states
-- having less than 2 properties registered in the system.
